# algorithms
1. The source code includes the algorithms implemented using ArrayList, BitSet and HashSet. The implementation with ArrayList is the fastest one.
2. To run the algorithm, the format of input parameters: input file name, the size k, the running time threshold, algorithm name . An example: inf-power.mtx 4939 600 TopDown
3. The algorithms were implemented recursively. To avoid stackoverflow issue, we may set VM arguments: -Xss10M. 
4. the input files are in the folder ''graphs'', and the output files are in folder '''outputs'ã€‚
